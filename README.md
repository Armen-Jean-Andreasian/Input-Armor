# Input Armor Python package

---
## About:  

InputArmor is designed to help you protect your Python applications from malicious input.

It provides protection against  security vulnerabilities, `SQL-injections`, `DOM-manipulation (HTML injections)`, and almost all types of injections due to its broad checkup data.

The package operates in a specific way. It doesn't return `True` or `False`.
- If the test passes: `None` will be returned.
- If the test fails:  `AssertionError` will be raised with a reason in the error body.


The package tests only the data of `str` type.
And yes, the user input that gotta be tested is called `rabbit`. ðŸ˜‰

## Functionality:

### InputArmor provides three checkup methods:

1. **Advanced check**
   - Check for non-utf-8 encoding of user input
   - Check for unsatisfying length of user input
   - Check for threats in a single word input
   - Check for most common keywords in user input
   - Check for punctuation symbols in user input
   - Check for undefined value as user input
2. **Sql Injection check**
3. **HTML Injection (DOM-Manipulation) check**


Both **Sql Injection** and **HTML Injection** checks:
- Have two levels:
    - soft check: Checks against a basic small list.
      - The small list of Sql Injection consists of 13 items.
      - The small list of HTML Injection (DOM-Manipulation) consists of 44 items.

    - deep check: check against a large list.
      - The large list of Sql Injection consists of 159 items.
      - The large list of HTML Injection consists of 127 items.

- Support:
  - white_list: An iterable with custom values that are allowed to have.
  - black_list: An iterable with custom values that are not allowed to have.

# The options provided by Advanced check:


> ### Check for non-utf-8 encoding

#### _Raises AssertionError if the encoding is not utf-8._

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "Ð¹, Ñž, Ñ—"

try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```

---

> ### Check for unsatisfying input length

#### _Check if the input has the given length or doesn't exceed it, or consists of whitespaces only._

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "login"
max_length = 3

try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input, check_length=True, max_length=max_length)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```
Similarly to this example, you can check for long input as well. 

---
> ### Check for threats in a single word input

#### _Specially designed checkup to detect threats injected into one word. Subsequently, works only with single word inputs._

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "1=1"

try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```
Similarly to wrong encoding check, no need to additional arguments to `.advanced_check()` method.
These are basic checks that should be done on any type of user input.

---

> ### Check for most common keywords 

####  _Elementary check for most frequently used keywords in the user input._

The keywords are `while`, `as`, `if`, `else`, `import`, `select`, `do`


```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "while true do something"

try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input, check_for_keywords=True)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```
---

> ### Check for punctuation symbols

#### _This check raises an AssertionError if **_any_** kind of non-alpha (non-letter) and non-numeric (non-number) symbol found in the input._

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "-- ls"


try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input, check_for_punctuation_symbols=True)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```
---

> ### Check for undefined value

#### _Useful in situations when you have a pool of pre-defined values and the input should be in it._

#### _If the user input is not found in your pool of `possible_values`, the check raises `AssertionError`._

#### `possible_values` should be any `Iterable` type.

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "banana"
pool = ("TNT", "ginger")

try:
    InputArmor.advanced_check(rabbit=user_input, check_for_undefined_value=True, possible_values=pool)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```

---

# Usage of Sql Injection check:

> ### Sql Injection check: Soft mode

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "drop table"

try:
    InputArmor.sql_injection_check(rabbit=user_input, check_level=1)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```

**Important note**: Check the lists of each mode, to adjust the security maximally. However, if you have your list of keywords, feel free to use them by providing them as `white_list` or `black_list`.

> ### Sql Injection check: Deep mode

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "update string"

try:
    InputArmor.sql_injection_check(user_input, check_level=2)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```

---

# Usage of HTML Injection check:

Similarly to Sql Injection check

> ### HTML Injection check. Soft mode
> 
```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "getElementById"

try:
    InputArmor.html_injection_check(rabbit=user_input, check_level=1)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```

**Important note**: Check the lists of each mode, to adjust the security maximally. However, if you have your list of keywords, feel free to use them by providing them as `white_list` or `black_list`.

> ### HTML Injection check. Deep mode

```python
from input_armor import InputArmor


user_input = "localStorage"

try:
    InputArmor.html_injection_check(user_input, check_level=2)
except AssertionError as details:
    # failure logic
    print(details)
    print(False)
else:
    # success logic
    print(True)
```
